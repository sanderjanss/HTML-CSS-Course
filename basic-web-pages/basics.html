      <h1>Internet is easy!</h1>
      <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
      <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <p>This is how you create unordered lists.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add a ul element, it stands for unordered list.</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own li element.</li>
        <li>They dont need to be in any particular order.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is how you create an ordered list.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Add a ul element, it stands for unordered list.</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own li element.</li>
        <li>They dont need to be in any particular order.</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in a specific order, because this is an ordered list.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
      <p><em>Sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
      <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphatize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
      <p><strong><em>And sometimes you need to shout!</em></strong></p>

      <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
      <p>Thanks for reading internetting should be easier now!</p>

      <p>Regards, <br/>
        The Authors
